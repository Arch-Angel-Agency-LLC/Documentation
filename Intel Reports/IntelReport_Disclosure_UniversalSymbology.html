<h1>Page 2: Detailed Mathematical Proofs and Examples</h1>
    <p><strong>Objective</strong>: Provide rigorous mathematical proofs and detailed examples to satisfy critiques from Mathematics, Physics, and Applied Mathematics professors.</p>

    <h2>1. Detailed Proofs of Geometric Invariants</h2>

    <h3>1.1. Circle Invariance Under Rotation</h3>
    <p><strong>Proof</strong>: Given a circle with the equation \((x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\), we aim to prove its invariance under rotation about its center \((h, k)\).</p>

    <p><strong>Transformation Equations</strong>: A rotation matrix \( R(\theta) = \begin{pmatrix} \cos\theta & -\sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & \cos\theta \end{pmatrix} \) transforms the coordinates \( (x, y) \) around the origin.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Translate the circle to the origin:
            \[
            x' = x - h, \quad y' = y - k
            \]
        </li>
        <li>Apply the rotation:
            \[
            \begin{pmatrix} x'' \\ y'' \end{pmatrix} = R(\theta) \begin{pmatrix} x' \\ y' \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} \cos\theta & -\sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & \cos\theta \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} x' \\ y' \end{pmatrix}
            \]
            This gives:
            \[
            x'' = x' \cos\theta - y' \sin\theta
            \]
            \[
            y'' = x' \sin\theta + y' \cos\theta
            \]
        </li>
        <li>Substitute back into the circle equation:
            \[
            (x' \cos\theta - y' \sin\theta)^2 + (x' \sin\theta + y' \cos\theta)^2 = r^2
            \]
        </li>
        <li>Simplify using trigonometric identities:
            \[
            x'^2 (\cos^2\theta + \sin^2\theta) + y'^2 (\sin^2\theta + \cos^2\theta) = r^2
            \]
            \[
            x'^2 (1) + y'^2 (1) = r^2
            \]
            \[
            x'^2 + y'^2 = r^2
            \]
        </li>
        <li>Translate back:
            \[
            (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2
            \]
            The equation remains unchanged, proving the circle's invariance under rotation.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>1.2. Advanced Harmonic Analysis</h3>
    <p><strong>Fourier Analysis of Complex Waveforms</strong>: Given a complex waveform \( f(x) \), decompose it into a sum of sinusoidal components using Fourier series.</p>

    <p><strong>Fourier Series</strong>:
        \[
        f(x) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \left( a_n \cos\left(\frac{2\pi nx}{L}\right) + b_n \sin\left(\frac{2\pi nx}{L}\right) \right)
        \]
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Calculate Fourier coefficients \( a_n \) and \( b_n \):
            \[
            a_n = \frac{2}{L} \int_{0}^{L} f(x) \cos\left(\frac{2\pi nx}{L}\right) \, dx
            \]
            \[
            b_n = \frac{2}{L} \int_{0}^{L} f(x) \sin\left(\frac{2\pi nx}{L}\right) \, dx
            \]
        </li>
        <li>Reconstruct the waveform using the calculated coefficients:
            \[
            f(x) = a_0 + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \left( a_n \cos\left(\frac{2\pi nx}{L}\right) + b_n \sin\left(\frac{2\pi nx}{L}\right) \right)
            \]
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>Proof of Superposition Principle</strong>: If \( y_1 = A \sin(kx - \omega t) \) and \( y_2 = A \sin(kx - \omega t + \phi) \), the resultant wave \( y = y_1 + y_2 \) can be written as:
        \[
        y = A \sin(kx - \omega t) + A \sin(kx - \omega t + \phi)
        \]
        Using the trigonometric identity for sum of sine functions:
        \[
        \sin A + \sin B = 2 \sin\left(\frac{A + B}{2}\right) \cos\left(\frac{A - B}{2}\right)
        \]
        This gives:
        \[
        y = 2A \sin\left(kx - \omega t + \frac{\phi}{2}\right) \cos\left(\frac{\phi}{2}\right)
        \]
        The superposition results in a wave with amplitude \( 2A \cos\left(\frac{\phi}{2}\right) \) and phase shift \( \frac{\phi}{2} \).
    </p>

    <h3>1.3. Application of Curvature in Geometry</h3>
    <p><strong>Curvature of a Curve</strong>: The curvature \( \kappa \) of a curve defined parametrically by \( (x(t), y(t)) \) is:
        \[
        \kappa = \frac{|x'y'' - y'x''|}{\left( (x')^2 + (y')^2 \right)^{3/2}}
        \]
    </p>
    <p><strong>Example</strong>: Consider a parametric curve defined by \( x(t) = a \cos(t) \) and \( y(t) = b \sin(t) \):
        <ol>
            <li>First derivatives:
                \[
                x' = -a \sin(t), \quad y' = b \cos(t)
                \]
            </li>
            <li>Second derivatives:
                \[
                x'' = -a \cos(t), \quad y'' = -b \sin(t)
                \]
            </li>
            <li>Compute the curvature:
                \[
                \kappa = \frac{|-a \sin(t)(-b \sin(t)) - b \cos(t)(-a \cos(t))|}{\left( (-a \sin(t))^2 + (b \cos(t))^2 \right)^{3/2}}
                \]
                \[
                \kappa = \frac{ab (\sin^2(t) + \cos^2(t))}{\left( a^2 \sin^2(t) + b^2 \cos^2(t) \right)^{3/2}}
                \]
                \[
                \kappa = \frac{ab}{\left( a^2 \sin^2(t) + b^2 \cos^2(t) \right)^{3/2}}
                \]
                This calculation demonstrates the curvature of an ellipse at different points.

    <p><strong>Objective</strong>: Provide more rigorous mathematical proofs and detailed examples to satisfy critiques from Mathematics, Physics, and Applied Mathematics professors.</p>

    <h2>1. Detailed Proofs of Geometric Invariants</h2>

    <h3>1.1. Circle Invariance Under Rotation</h3>
    <p><strong>Proof</strong>: Given a circle with the equation \((x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\), we aim to prove its invariance under rotation about its center \((h, k)\).</p>

    <p><strong>Transformation Equations</strong>: A rotation matrix \( R(\theta) = \begin{pmatrix} \cos\theta & -\sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & \cos\theta \end{pmatrix} \) transforms the coordinates \( (x, y) \) around the origin.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Translate the circle to the origin:
            \[
            x' = x - h, \quad y' = y - k
            \]
        </li>
        <li>Apply the rotation:
            \[
            \begin{pmatrix} x'' \\ y'' \end{pmatrix} = R(\theta) \begin{pmatrix} x' \\ y' \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} \cos\theta & -\sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & \cos\theta \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} x' \\ y' \end{pmatrix}
            \]
            This gives:
            \[
            x'' = x' \cos\theta - y' \sin\theta
            \]
            \[
            y'' = x' \sin\theta + y' \cos\theta
            \]
        </li>
        <li>Substitute back into the circle equation:
            \[
            (x' \cos\theta - y' \sin\theta)^2 + (x' \sin\theta + y' \cos\theta)^2 = r^2
            \]
        </li>
        <li>Simplify using trigonometric identities:
            \[
            x'^2 (\cos^2\theta + \sin^2\theta) + y'^2 (\sin^2\theta + \cos^2\theta) = r^2
            \]
            \[
            x'^2 (1) + y'^2 (1) = r^2
            \]
            \[
            x'^2 + y'^2 = r^2
            \]
        </li>
        <li>Translate back:
            \[
            (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2
            \]
            The equation remains unchanged, proving the circle's invariance under rotation.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>1.2. Advanced Harmonic Analysis</h3>
    <p><strong>Fourier Analysis of Complex Waveforms</strong>: Given a complex waveform \( f(x) \), decompose it into a sum of sinusoidal components using Fourier series.</p>

    <p><strong>Fourier Series</strong>:
        \[
        f(x) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \left( a_n \cos\left(\frac{2\pi nx}{L}\right) + b_n \sin\left(\frac{2\pi nx}{L}\right) \right)
        \]
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Calculate Fourier coefficients \( a_n \) and \( b_n \):
            \[
            a_n = \frac{2}{L} \int_{0}^{L} f(x) \cos\left(\frac{2\pi nx}{L}\right) \, dx
            \]
            \[
            b_n = \frac{2}{L} \int_{0}^{L} f(x) \sin\left(\frac{2\pi nx}{L}\right) \, dx
            \]
        </li>
        <li>Reconstruct the waveform using the calculated coefficients:
            \[
            f(x) = a_0 + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \left( a_n \cos\left(\frac{2\pi nx}{L}\right) + b_n \sin\left(\frac{2\pi nx}{L}\right) \right)
            \]
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>Proof of Superposition Principle</strong>: If \( y_1 = A \sin(kx - \omega t) \) and \( y_2 = A \sin(kx - \omega t + \phi) \), the resultant wave \( y = y_1 + y_2 \) can be written as:
        \[
        y = A \sin(kx - \omega t) + A \sin(kx - \omega t + \phi)
        \]
        Using the trigonometric identity for sum of sine functions:
        \[
        \sin A + \sin B = 2 \sin\left(\frac{A + B}{2}\right) \cos\left(\frac{A - B}{2}\right)
        \]
        This gives:
        \[
        y = 2A \sin\left(kx - \omega t + \frac{\phi}{2}\right) \cos\left(\frac{\phi}{2}\right)
        \]
        The superposition results in a wave with amplitude \( 2A \cos\left(\frac{\phi}{2}\right) \) and phase shift \( \frac{\phi}{2} \).
    </p>

    <h3>1.3. Application of Curvature in Geometry</h3>

        \kappa = \frac{|x'y'' - y'x''|}{\left( (x')^2 + (y')^2 \right)^{3/2}}
        \]
    </p>
    <p><strong>Example</strong>: Consider a parametric curve defined by \( x(t) = a \cos(t) \) and \( y(t) = b \sin(t) \):
        <ol>
            <li>First derivatives:
                \[
                x' = -a \sin(t), \quad y' = b \cos(t)
                \]
            </li>
            <li>Second derivatives:
                \[
                x'' = -a \cos(t), \quad y'' = -b \sin(t)
                \]
            </li>
            <li>Compute the curvature:
                \[
                \kappa = \frac{|-a \sin(t)(-b \sin(t)) - b \cos(t)(-a \cos(t))|}{\left( (-a \sin(t))^2 + (b \cos(t))^2 \right)^{3/2}}
                \]
                \[
                \kappa = \frac{ab (\sin^2(t) + \cos^2(t))}{\left( a^2 \sin^2(t) + b^2 \cos^2(t) \right)^{3/2}}
                \]
                \[
                \kappa = \frac{ab}{\left( a^2 \sin^2(t) + b^2 \cos^2(t) \right)^{3/2}}
                \]
                This calculation demonstrates the curvature of an ellipse at different points.
